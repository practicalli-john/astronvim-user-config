# Practicalli AstroNvim User Configuration

An AstroNvim user configuration for [Practicalli Neovim](https://practical.li/neovim/), providing a Clojure REPL workflow, rich Git and GitHub clients and easy management of plugins and tools.

# AstroNvim version 3 only

AstroNvim version 4 has just been released and requires a significant change to the Practicalli config.

[practicalli/astronvim-user-config](https://github.com/practicalli/astronvim-user-config) repository is under development, although already provides the essential Clojure development tools.

Once the new configuration is established, this configuration will be archived.
